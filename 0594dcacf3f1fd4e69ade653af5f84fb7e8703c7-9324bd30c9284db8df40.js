Critical illness insurance will pay a tax-free lump sum of money when an individual is diagnosed with a critical illness. Most policies cover over 25 types of illnesses, and adding certain policy riders may entail a return of all the premiums upon expiration should no claims be made. This type of insurance is a powerful risk management tool, while potentially acting as a means of savings as well."}],"statement":{"title":"More insurance products","text":"The products listed are just a subset of what we offer.
